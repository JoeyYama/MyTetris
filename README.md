# MyTetris

My first venture into writing an Android Game app. 

## Acknowledgement

Thanks to Simplified Coding and their Android Game Development Tutorial for helping with the general code structure.

Unfortunately, I do not recall exactly which sites - I went to many - where I went to for assistance with the Tetris 
concepts. I did a lot of comparing and picking out what I liked. Nevertheless, I finished this app on my own as I didn't
like/get the logic and just went with what made sense to me. 

## Comment
As this is an amalgamation of multiple ideas, I imagine that this is not the best way to code a project.

## Question
I have read a lot about writing code bits, but is there a good resource on the coding process? How does one know what tests
one should be writing.
